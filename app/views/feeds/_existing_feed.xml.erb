First, Erin takes us through the efforts by the Michigan GOP to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic administration and why it’s a disaster no matter which way you cut it. Then, Bryan gives the lowdown on newly appointed White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, pointing out his extensive history of anti-LGBTQ policies and also the time he called his now-boss Trump a ‘terrible human being’.

Then, Erin takes us through the latest positive trend in South Korean feminism as women are destroying their cosmetics in defiance of a culture that emphasizes physical beauty above all else.</p><p><br></p><p><em>And make sure to check out Deeper Shade of Shade on Stitcher Premium, where Bryan and Erin interview their favorite friends of the show.
